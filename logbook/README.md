# HCI Project Logbook Template

This is the template for the project logbook for the course Human Computer Interaction. It reflects the different stages of the project and can be used as a guide to the data that needs to be collected or generated along the project.

The structure of the template is a suggestion and, whenever deemed relevant, students may change or expand it to encompass the characteristics of their project. 

Comments, suggestions, and new ideas are more than welcome.
